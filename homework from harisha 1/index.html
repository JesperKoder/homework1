      <p>
        Formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1991,[1][2] the group was originally called
        "Band Aid Boys". They then formed B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e, which consisted
        of four members—Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, Bizzy Bone, and Wish Bone
        (all except for Flesh-n-Bone)—and recorded an album titled Faces of
        Death in the studio of their then-mentor, Kermit Henderson on his indie
        label Stoney Burke in 1993.

      >
      <p>
        Released in June 1994, Creepin on ah Come Up was Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's
        debut with Ruthless. The album's subject matter was focused almost
        entirely on violent criminal activity. Peaking at No. 12 on the
        Billboard Top 200 Albums chart and No. 2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums
        chart,[12] it included the hit singles "Thuggish Ruggish Bone" and "Foe
        tha Love of $", the second of which featured a verse by Eazy-E.

        ><h3>1995–96: E. 1999 Eternal</h3></a
      >
      <p>
        In 1995, the group's second album, E. 1999 Eternal, was released. It
        included the singles "1st of tha Month", which peaked at No. 12 on the
        Hot 100 and No. 4 on Hot Rap Tracks, and "Tha Crossroads", which reached
        No. 1 on both the Hot 100 and Hot Rap Tracks charts. The album generally
        saw positive reviews from critics as Bone had diversified its content
        and musical style. Critics were particularly intrigued by the album due
        to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's ability to reduce the banality associated with
        gangsta rap in their music at a time when the subgenre had become
        exceedingly cliché.
